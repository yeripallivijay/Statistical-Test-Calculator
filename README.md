## 🧐 About The Project

In the workflow of an AI Engineer, understanding data distribution and hypothesis testing is the backbone of model selection and evaluation. However, manually calculating these tests or writing boilerplate code for every visualization slows down the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** phase.

I built this **Statistical Test Calculator** to solve that problem. It bridges the gap between raw mathematical concepts and visual understanding, allowing users to:
1.  Input their data parameters.
2.  Select a statistical test.
3.  **Immediately visualize** the results and probability distributions.

### 🎯 Key Features
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** dynamic charts that update in real-time based on user input.
*   **Hypothesis Testing:** Calculate Z-scores, T-scores, and P-values instantly.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a clean, distraction-free experience.
*   **Efficiency:** Reduces the time needed to validate statistical assumptions for machine learning models.
